# Lopa_Button â€” Arduino library to debounce button switches, detect presses and releases
Drop-in replacement for https://github.com/alextaujenis/RBD_Button/ library for Arduino.

There is a [bug](https://github.com/alextaujenis/RBD_Button/issues/6) in RBD_Button library, that was critical in my case and it was much simpler for me to write a replacement from scratch. Library is stable.
